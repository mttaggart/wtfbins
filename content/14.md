They were spawned in succession from `C:\Program Files (x86)\noregon\JPRO diagnostics\Fleets.exe` > `C:\Program Files (x86)\noregon\JPRO diagnostics_jpro_start.exe` > `C:\Users\AppData\Local\icsys.icn.exe > c:\Windows\System\explorer.exe` > `C:\Windows\System\spoolsv.exe` > `C:\Windows\System\svchost.exe`.

The files are custom binaries compiled with Visual Basic. They appear to be changed/created regularly as the hashes seem to change often.
