IBM creates WMI false positives

<!-- more -->
   
The data collector periodically runs a command like: `cmd.exe /c wmic process call create `C:\...\datacollectorbin\collectorSrvWatchDog.bat`.

This may trigger detection rules geared towards T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation which look for `wmic.exe` being used to covertly spawn processes.
