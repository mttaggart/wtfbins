Not just bad guys run `whoami`.

`ArcGISPortal.exe` runs `whoami.exe`.
I know other Defenders have been [caught out](https://twitter.com/MikeDaniels00/status/1407383747985653769) by this weird activity. But, ArcGIS spawning whoami is completely legitimate and authorised activity. Huntress telemetry shows ~60,000 in the last 15 hours. I would advice adding this very specific activity to an ignore list, so it does not trigger a detection.
