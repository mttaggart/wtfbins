Adobe performs...process injection??

<!-- more -->

Adobe Creative Cloud setup spawns and injects code to explorer.exe for deleting itself. The injected function calls `WaitForSingleObject(INFINITE)` on the injector's process duplicated handle, then `CloseHandle` it, follows to loop over `DeleteFileW` to retry while it fails with an inner `Sleep(1000)` until success, then calls `ExitProcess(0)`.
