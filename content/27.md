Random file extensions from iManage

<!-- more -->
   
When Office documents are protected by iManage, upon opening them they create script files in `%TEMP%` with a randomly generated file extension (such as `.hta`, `.sct`, `.inf`, `.cpl`, `.wsf`, etc.). This happens because iManage implements the `Path.GetRandomFileName` Method to handle this behavior. So while most instances result in files that look like `x191krbu.idj`, sometimes they end up being written like `x191krbu.hta` which likely will wreak havoc on a good defender's SIEM rules.
