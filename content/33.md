Windows being sus? Inconceivable!

<!-- more -->

Windows executes a suspiciously named DLL export with a name of `SusRunTask`, and this DLL checks many various Scheduled Task and Autostart execution locations, such as Registry persistence locations and `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`, as well as spawning new processes that are not child processes.
